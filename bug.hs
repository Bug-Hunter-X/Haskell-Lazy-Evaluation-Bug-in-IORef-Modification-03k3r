This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction with mutable state. The `modifyIORef` function updates the `IORef` in place, but the effect of this update might not be visible immediately because of lazy evaluation.  The `getIORef` call within the `loop` function might read the `IORef` before the `modifyIORef` has fully updated it.

```haskell
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)
import Control.Concurrent (newIORef, modifyIORef, getIORef)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  counter <- newIORef 0
  loop counter 10

loop :: IORef Int -> Int -> IO ()
loop counter remainingTimes = do
  current <- liftIO $ getIORef counter
  print current
  if remainingTimes > 0 then do
    liftIO $ modifyIORef counter (+ 1)
    loop counter (remainingTimes - 1)
  else return ()
```
